# NeuroLinkAI: Deep Learning-Driven Neuroprosthetic Control Interface

## Overview
NeuroLinkAI leverages advanced deep learning technologies, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to interpret and translate brain signals into actionable commands for controlling neuroprosthetic devices. This project aims to enhance autonomy for individuals with mobility impairments due to spinal cord injuries, strokes, and similar conditions.

## Key Features
- **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)**: Converts EEG signals into direct commands for neuroprosthetics.
- **Deep Learning**: Uses LSTM networks for accurate and real-time interpretation of neural signals.
- **Accessibility**: Designed to improve the quality of life for individuals with severe mobility disabilities.

## Installation
To set up the NeuroLinkAI system, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/Rkpani05/NeuroLinkAi-Deep_Learning_Driven_Neuroprosthetic_Control_Interface.git]`
2. Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`

## Usage
- Ensure that a compatible EEG headset is properly connected.
- Run the system to begin signal acquisition and real-time processing.

## System Architecture
NeuroLinkAI includes several key components:
- **EEG Signal Acquisition**: Captures brain signals using non-invasive EEG headsets.
- **Preprocessing Module**: Filters and standardizes EEG signals.
- **Feature Extraction Module**: Extracts significant features from EEG data.
- **Deep Learning Module**: Analyzes features to predict user intentions.
- **Control Interface**: Translates predictions into prosthetic commands.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For overall programming.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: For implementing LSTM networks.
- **MNE-Python**: For EEG signal processing.
